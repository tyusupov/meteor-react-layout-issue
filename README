This is a demonstration of an issue with ReactLayout.

When this app is run the following happens:

1. React creates not 1 but two Apps
2. These apps are mounted on 2 divs:
 - myapp - as expected
 - react-root - totally unexpected

3. Content is displayed twice.

 If FlowRouter block is uncommented in main.jsx then everything 
 works as expected.

 Also, if ReactLayout is replaced with ReactDOM all works fine, 
 which leads me to believe the issue is with meteor-react-layout.
